    "1) **The simplest explanation is always the most probable.**\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **Children do not overcomplicate things like adults do.** Developing talent in childhood often depends mainly on the parents and how they encourage their children. If a child enjoys something, or at least it is presented as fun by the parents, and the child engages with it\n",
    "Another essential part that makes you successful is that you know your goal. \n",

    "3) Imagine the following scenario:\n",

    "Now let us change the scenario a little bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your instructor instructs you to move to the other corner. We start moving, and the instructor puts a chair in our way again. What will we do? You will pass the chair and continue moving forward to the corner ***because you know your goal.***\n",
    "\n",
    "4) **However, first of all, we have to fail.** It is an unavoidable and essential part of learning. The Pareto principle states that with 20% of the effort, we can achieve 80% of the effect. Looking back and seeing how far we have come will keep us motivated. Many people struggle during the learning process because they have to learn a lot of different topics. It is vital to take breaks and remain calm.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Consciousness describes the totality of all those mental processes by which we become aware of the external and our internal world with active observation. Therefore, when we actively observe that we are looking at a monitor full of text and can decide to change the situation if necessary and intentionally look elsewhere, we are in consciousness.\n",

    "We can eliminate external influences more easily than many might think. All we need is our clearly defined goal. If we have such a goal that we follow passionately, hardly anyone will talk us out of it. It is even less likely if we know that we can achieve this goal.\n",

    "\n",
    "Task\t|Protocol\t|Description\n",
    "---|---|---\n",
    "Logical Addressing|\tIP|\tDue to many hosts in different networks, there is a need to structure the network topology and logical addressing. Within TCP/IP, IP takes over the logical addressing of networks and nodes. Data packets only reach the network where they are supposed to be. The methods to do so are network classes, subnetting, and CIDR.\n",
    "Routing\t|IP|\tFor each data packet, the next node is determined in each node on the way from the sender to the receiver. This way, a data packet is routed to its receiver, even if its location is unknown to the sender.\n",
    "Error & Control Flow|\tTCP|\tThe sender and receiver are frequently in touch with each other via a virtual connection. Therefore control messages are sent continuously to check if the connection is still established.\n",
    "Application Support|\tTCP|TCP and UDP ports form a software abstraction to distinguish specific applications and their communication links.\n",
    "Name Resolution|\tDNS|\tDNS provides name resolution through Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDN) in IP addresses, enabling us to reach the desired host with the specified name on the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **IPv4**\n",
    "Each host in the network located can be identified by the so-called Media Access Control address (MAC). This would allow data exchange within this one network. If the remote host is located in another network, knowledge of the MAC address is not enough to establish a connection. Addressing on the Internet is done via the IPv4 and/or IPv6 address, which is made up of the network address and the host address.\\\n",
    "It does not matter whether it is a smaller network, such as a home computer network, or the entire Internet. The IP address ensures the delivery of data to the correct receiver. We can imagine the representation of MAC and IPv4 / IPv6 addresses as follows:\\\n",
    "IPv4 / IPv6 - describes the unique postal address and district of the receiver's building.\\\n",
    "MAC - describes the exact floor and apartment of the receiver.\\\n",
    "It is possible for a single IP address to address multiple receivers (broadcasting) or for a device to respond to multiple IP addresses. However, it must be ensured that each IP address is assigned only once within the network.\n",

    "The broadcast address is the last IP address in a network and is used to send data to all devices on the network. It is the last IP address in a network.\\\n",
    "A further separation of these classes into small networks is done with the help of subnetting. This separation is done using the netmasks, which is as long as an IPv4 address. As with classes, it describes which bit positions within the IP address act as network part or host part.\n",
    "\n",
    "**CIDR**\n",
    "Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) is a method of representation and replaces the fixed assignment between IPv4 address and network classes (A, B, C, D, E). The division is based on the subnet mask or the so-called CIDR suffix, which allows the bitwise division of the IPv4 address space and thus into subnets of any size. The CIDR suffix indicates how many bits from the beginning of the IPv4 address belong to the network. It is a notation that represents the subnet mask by specifying the number of 1-bits in the subnet mask.\\\n",

    "--|--\n",
    "Kerberos\t|Key Distribution Center (KDC) based authentication protocol that uses tickets in domain environments.\n",
    "SRP\t|This is a password-based authentication protocol that uses cryptography to protect against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.\n",
    "SSL|\tA cryptographic protocol used for secure communication over a computer network.\n",
    "TLS\t|TLS is a cryptographic protocol that provides communication security over the internet. It is the successor to SSL.\n",
    "OAuth|\tAn open standard for authorization that allows users to grant third-party access to their web resources without sharing their passwords.\n",
    "OpenID|\tOpenID is a decentralized authentication protocol that allows users to use a single identity to sign in to multiple websites.\n",
    "SAML\t|Security Assertion Markup Language is an XML-based standard for securely exchanging authentication and authorization data between parties.\n",
    "2FA\t|An authentication method that uses a combination of two different factors to verify a user's identity.\n",
    "FIDO|\tThe Fast IDentity Online Alliance is a consortium of companies working to develop open standards for strong authentication.\n",
    "PKI\t|PKI is a system for securely exchanging information based on the use of public and private keys for encryption and digital signatures.\n",
    "SSO\t|An authentication method that allows a user to use a single set of credentials to access multiple applications.\n",
    "MFA\t|MFA is an authentication method that uses multiple factors, such as something the user knows (a password), something the user has (a phone), or something the user is (biometric data), to verify their identity.\n",
    "PAP\t|A simple authentication protocol that sends a user's password in clear text over the network.\n",
    "CHAP|\tAn authentication protocol that uses a three-way handshake to verify a user's identity.\n",
    "EAP|\tA framework for supporting multiple authentication methods, allowing for the use of various technologies to verify a user's identity.\n",
    "SSH\t|This is a network protocol for secure communication between a client and a server. We can use it for remote command-line access and remote command execution, as well as for secure file transfer. SSH uses encryption to protect against eavesdropping and other attacks and can also be used for authentication.\n",
    "HTTPS|\tThis is a secure version of the HTTP protocol used for communication on the internet. HTTPS uses SSL/TLS| to encrypt communication and provide authentication, ensuring that third parties cannot intercept and read the transmitted data. It is widely used for secure communication over the internet, particularly for web browsing.\n",
    "LEAP|\tLEAP is a wireless authentication protocol developed by Cisco. It uses EAP to provide mutual authentication between a wireless client and a server and uses the RC4 encryption algorithm to encrypt communication between the two. Unfortunately, LEAP is vulnerable to dictionary attacks and other security vulnerabilities and has been largely replaced by more secure protocols such as EAP-TLS and PEAP.\n",
    "PEAP|\tPEAP on the other hand is a secure tunneling protocol used for wireless and wired networks. It is based on EAP and uses TLS to encrypt communication between a client and a server. PEAP uses a server-side certificate to authenticate the server and can also be used to authenticate the client using various methods, such as passwords, certificates, or biometric data. PEAP is widely used in enterprise networks for secure authentication.\n",

    "As our code grows in complexity, we need to start refactoring our code to make more efficient use of the instructions and make it easier to read and understand. A common way to do so is through the use of functions and procedures. While functions require a calling procedure to call them and pass their arguments (as we will discuss in the next section), procedures are usually more straightforward and mainly used for code refactoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "**CALL/RET**\n",
    "When we want to start executing a procedure, we can call it, and it will go through its instructions. The call instruction pushes (i.e., saves) the next instruction pointer rip to the stack and then jumps to the specified procedure.\\\n",
    "Once the procedure is executed, we should end it with a ret instruction to return to the point we were at before jumping to the procedure. The ret instruction pops the address at the top of the stack into rip, so the program's next instruction is restored to what it was before jumping to the procedure.\n",

    "Dynamic Linking: \n",
    "We can now assemble our code with nasm. When we link our code with `ld`, we should tell it to do dynamic linking with the libc library. Otherwise, it would not know how to fetch the imported printf function. We can do so with the `-lc --dynamic-linker /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 flags`\n",
