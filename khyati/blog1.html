                                <p>India has equal justice system for every individual with IPC, CPC and other
                                    substantive and procedural laws except a loophole of personal laws which vary from
                                    religion to religion.
                                    In this nation of cultural diversity and symphony, people have different rules and
                                    laws to follow according to their religions and community.
                                    With 110 crore Hindus,20 crore muslims,4 crore Christians and 3 crore Sikhs, would
                                    it ever be possible to bring UCC to existence?
                                    Imagine you live in a land where the same law applies to everyone despite their
                                    religions and community. Imagine you live in turkey, Tunisia, Albania or France.
                                    Let’s unravel the story of a legal revolution: The Uniform Civil Code(UCC), either
                                    it gets implemented or not.</p>

                                <h3>WHAT IS UCC?</h3>
                                <p>Uniform Civil Code does not mean that after implementation, everyone has to take
                                    seven rounds for marriage pr imposing one religion’s customs on another. Uniformity
                                    would mean registering all these marriages. Thus, The uniform civil code is a
                                    proposal in India to draft and execute personal laws of citizens which apply on all
                                    citizens of the nation despite their religion, sexual orientation and gender. The
                                    primary objective of UCC is to promote secularism and elimination of religious legal
                                    distinctions.
                                    Uniform civil code represents the concept of equal rights and justice without any
                                    bias. UCC would be legislative enforcement or interference to make fundamental
                                    rights more supreme.</p>

                                <h3>HISTORY</h3>
                                <p>India is a country of different culture and diversities with more than 1721 languages
                                    spoken here and different communities living throughout the nation.
                                    Before the independence of India, British raj reigned the country as well as the
                                    rules. British raj did introduce the set of personal laws mainly for Hindus and
                                    Muslims, the main religions of the nation. Even though they were the supreme power,
                                    they feared religious wars. They chose not to risk and interfere with the religious
                                    sentiments of the people of the communities. At the time, Goa was separated from
                                    India due to colonial rule and thus retained a common family law known as Goa civil
                                    code and is the only state in India with a uniform civil code in India. Ironically,
                                    the Goan civil code is not uniform as it has special provisions for different
                                    communities.
                                    For example; Bigamy is allowed to Hindu men if the wife does not deliver a child
                                    before the age of 25 or a male child till the age of 30.
                                    Post independence; In 1950s, election was fought and it was promised that the Hindu
                                    code bill will be passed. The process of creating the Hindu Personal Code involved
                                    extensive discussions and consultations with various stakeholders, including legal
                                    experts, religious leaders, social reformers, and representatives from the Hindu
                                    community. The objective was to address the inequalities and discriminatory
                                    practices prevalent in traditional Hindu personal laws and bring about social
                                    reforms. Hindu code bills were introduced which had special provisions and reformed
                                    personal laws in various communities and religions like Hindus. Jains, Sikhs,
                                    Buddhists but the bill exempted Christians, jews, Muslims and Parsis, being
                                    considered different and foreign communities than India.
                                    UCC rose as an important topic of interests in Indian politics following the Shah
                                    Bano case of 1985. People could not pick a side on making certain laws applicable to
                                    all citizens without breaking the fundamental rights of right to freedom of practice
                                    of religion. Afterwards, the debate rose then focused on the Muslim personal law
                                    which is partially based on the Sharia law, permitting unilateral divorce, polygamy.

                                <h3>PRESENT TIMES</h3>
                                <p>Implementation on the uniform civil code across this nation is the work of India’s
                                    ruling party, Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP)
                                    BJP has mentioned UCC various times in their election manifesto and even won those
                                    elections but UCC remains pending. Personal laws cover marriages, divorces,
                                    inheritance and adoption. UCC was introduced in India twice, once in 2019 and once
                                    in 2020 but the strict opposition forced the government to take it back. In year
                                    2023, it was introduced again by Mr. Narendra Modi as an answer to equality before
                                    the constitution and it is still facing a strong opposition from various
                                    communities.
                                    In march, when a PIL was filed in Supreme court to pass UCC, the court declared,
                                    “The court is a wrong forum to enact UCC and only the parliament can make a law on
                                    this.”
                                    “Think about it many times so that no storm shall come anywhere if steps are taken
                                    on it”, cited Kapil Sibal, a known Indian politician(Samajwadi party) and lawyer.
                                </p>
                                <h3>DILEMMA:</h3>
                                <p>While Article 25 to 28 of the Indian constitution promise religious freedom to Indian
                                    citizens and allows religious groups to maintain their own affairs, article 44 of
                                    the constitution expects the Indian constitution to apply directive principles and
                                    common law for all Indian citizens while formulating national policies.
                                    Is UCC a Hindu-Muslim debate? The common people of India are not willing to fully
                                    understand the concept and think about it as a debate between the two religions on
                                    the basis of the historical differences and commotion. In reality, UCC is intended
                                    to remove the discriminatory and prejudicial laws which are clearly wrong. This law
                                    will be more beneficial for the female population as it would give equal marital
                                    rights to all.</p>

                                <h3>VIEWS AND STANCE BY DIFFERENT PARTIES:</h3>
                                <p>While BJP still stands with the implementation of UCC, there are various political
                                    parties with their views and stand.</p>

                                <p> • Congress: It will be difficult to implement UCC in a country like India where
                                    various communities and groups are governed by personal laws
                                    "On June 15 we issued a statement, but there is no change in stand on UCC. When
                                    there's a draft and a discussion we will participate and examine what is proposed.
                                    As of now, all we have is the Law Commission public notice for responses. The
                                    Congress reiterates the statement as nothing new has happened.”, cites Jairam
                                    Ramesh, Congress general secretary.
                                    • CPM: Any move to push the agenda of UCC, as is being done by the government
                                    directly and through its institutions, is counterproductive for the rights of women.
                                    Uniformity is not the guarantee for equality.
                                    • Shiv Sena: The Muslim Law Board should support the UCC as it will help the
                                    community, especially the women to come out of misery.
                                    • BSP: BJP has been trying to impose the agenda of the RSS on the people ever since
                                    it came to power at the Centre.
                                    •  RJD: If BJP wants to apply the Uniform Civil Code, they should first apply that
                                    in Jammu and Kashmir as they are in power there.
                                    •  "Firstly Prime Minister should inform the country what is the proposal for UCC
                                    and on what issues does he want uniformity. Until a proposal is put forward, there
                                    is no need for a debate”, said Kapil Sibal (July 1, 2023)</p>


                                <p>It is important to note that the views of the political parties may or may not be
                                    biased and their official statements are merely their views and concerns about the
                                    implementation of a revolutionary cultural law.</p>

                                <h3>DRAWBACKS OF UCC:</h3>
                                <p>As important as it is to make a law, it is more important to know how to implement
                                    it. UCC has several problems from describing it and it's goal properly to making it
                                    as a law and even putting it into function. Before UCC is implemented there should
                                    be a mindset and a culture that every Indian citizen is a Indian citizen and laws
                                    are not from the perspective of anyone's birth. This is very difficult and
                                    challenging as it will not be accepted widely. While UCC is a major public diversity
                                    concern;
                                <ol>
                                    <li> There is a wrong mass perception about the law that it is against the religious
                                        freedom of people. </li>
                                    <li>It is a sensitive topic.</li>
                                    <li>Practical difficulties due to diversity</li>
                                    <li> the help of state, it would be difficult to implement it.</li>
                                    <li>The transition from multiple personal laws to a single uniform code could have
                                        unintended consequences on various aspects of society. It might disrupt existing
                                        social norms, familial relationships, and inheritance patterns, which could lead
                                        to unforeseen challenges and grievances</li>
                                </ol>
                                The states are divided on the basis of their stance on UCC. States like Uttar Pradesh,
                                Uttarakhand, Haryana, Gujarat, Assam and Maharashtra stand with it while states like
                                Meghalaya, Nagaland and Mizoram oppose it.
                                The 21st law commission had declared the issue not desirable or necessary due to the
                                practical problems like;
                                In Hindu marriages, the marriage is considered a holy sacrament; in Christians, divorce
                                is stigmatised; in Muslims, marriage is a contract and in Parsis, registration of
                                marriages is important.
                                Thus it becomes important to respect all these attitudes and one religion cannot be
                                imposed on another.
                                Now even if the UCC is not brought to existence, the state can still remove injustices
                                by making amendments in personal laws. Filtering the regressive aspects in personal laws
                                is also a good alternative.</p>

                                <p>All in all, It’s of significance to note out that there is also a difference between
