                                <h4>"Older men declare war. But it is the youth that must fight and die.", Cited Herbert
                                    Hoover once.</h4>

                                <p>The situation in Gaza has been marked by conflicts and wars over the years, with a
                                    significant impact on the lives of its residents, including young people.</p>

                                <p> While the Palestinian children plead for help from others, the Israeli citizens can
                                    be seen in terrors and tears as their towns are bombed down by Hamas.</p>

                                <br> bombs dropping down from either sides are not only killing innocent souls but
                                crushing the innocent dreams of the citizens, the children.

                                <br>An interview was conducted by film makers in 2021, “What is your dream?” to children
                                of Palestine.

                                <b><br>“I want to have a car like Christiano Ronaldo’s. I’m a good football player. Go
                                    bring the football so I can show him.”, the kid said smiling.

                                    <br>“I want to become a doctor so I can treat the wounded people”, an 8 year girl
                                    said.

                                    <br>“For them to stop bombing our houses.”</b>, another girl said.it many times so
                                that no storm shall come anywhere if steps are taken
                                on it”, cited Kapil Sibal, a known Indian politician(Samajwadi party) and lawyer.
                                </p>
                                <p>While Article 25 to 28 of the Indian constitution promise religious freedom to Indian
                                    citizens and allows religious groups to maintain their own affairs, article 44 of
                                    the constitution expects the Indian constitution to apply directive principles and
                                    common law for all Indian citizens while formulating national policies.
                                    Is UCC a Hindu-Muslim debate? The common people of India are not willing to fully
                                    understand the concept and think about it as a debate between the two religions on
                                    the basis of the historical differences and commotion. In reality, UCC is intended
                                    to remove the discriminatory and prejudicial laws which are clearly wrong. This law
                                    will be more beneficial for the female population as it would give equal marital
                                    rights to all.</p>

                                <p>
                                    “To get back to al asqa mosque and to our homeland. To our home and my grandfather’s
                                    old house. To reach there and see it.”, a kid told

                                    <br>“What else?”

                                    <br>“Is there a bigger dream than going home?” was the answer.

                                    <br>We don’t even know how many children are even alive. The children who got killed
                                    in the war had dreams and aspirations. It's an entire lifetime of hardship and
                                    struggle manifested in the body of a child.

                                    <br>There is still no end to the suffering of innocent citizens.

                                    <br>“It was an accident.”, say soldiers while they shot down a toddler.

                                    <br>"The greatest cruelty is our casual blindness to the despair of others." -
                                    Unknown

                                    <br>There is no hiding that humanity has been eradicated from the hearts of people.

                                    <br>"The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched
                                    - they must be felt with the heart." Said Helen Keller.

                                <p> The newborns are seeing destruction as their first view which no one deserves.

                                <h3><br>After a big fight or war, what remains are not just the scars it left behind but
                                    also the strong human determination for peace and recovery in the middle of the
                                    destruction.</p>
